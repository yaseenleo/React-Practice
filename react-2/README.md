<h1>Practice Info</h1>
To begin I’ll give a quick definition of what this is in React. this in general refers to a JavaScript element depending on the scope or context of its use. So in React, when we define classes we use methods inside those classes to refer to attributes such as state and props. For our methods to have access to this.state and this.props we need to bind the React component this context to those methods. Binding this to the class methods enables us to access props and state for the component with this.props and this.state. A benefit of using arrow functions is that this is already bound to that function so we don’t need to specify that anywhere else.

<h3>Use arrow functions to avoid binding `this` to methods:</h3>
Usually when you want to access this inside a class method you would need to bind it to your method

Binding this to handleClick in the constructor allows us to use this.setState from Component inside handleClick. Without this binding, this is re-scoped for handleClick and therefore cannot be used with the setState method.

However using arrow functions makes this whole process unnecessary and leaves your code looking much nicer

The great thing about an arrow function is that this means the same thing within the function body as it does outside of it. Which means that if you use arrow functions within your component’s render, they can access this and this.setState. Doing this I can call handleClick in just one line.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
